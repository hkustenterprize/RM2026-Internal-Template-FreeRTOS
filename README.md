- The directory `RM2025-Internal-Core/Drivers` contains the drivers. You may ignore the FreeRTOS and diagnostic directories as we have already set them up for you.
- Within `./Core/Inc/AppConfig.h`, you could enable/disable certain drivers and configure them. Port configurations had been configured according to the Internal board design.
- Tasks are created in `./Core/Src/UserTask.cpp`.
- Most of your code may happen in `RM2025-Internal-Core/Drivers` and `./Core/Src/UserTask.cpp`.
